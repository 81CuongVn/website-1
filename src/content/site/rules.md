# Rules

## General Rules

Below you will find the rules of the server. These are the do's and don'ts of being here. Follow them if you wish to stay, ignorance is not an excuse.

## 1. Do not advertise

This includes other servers, products or services that you stand to benefit from financially, your youtube channel or the like.

## 2. Do not be a dick

If you make yourself particularly hard to deal with, if you pretend that you are better than anyone else, or if you are just in general very annoying and not a good fit for this server we will remove you. Permanently.

## 3. Use facts, not authority

If you are going to provide anecdote or your own experience, that is fine, provided you don't pass it off as axiomatic. Quote sources when you are asked to.

## 4. Do not flame languages or other such technologies (e.g. text editors)

Doing so is reductive. If someone likes to use VB.Net or JavaScript or Vim, we surprisingly expect you to not jump down their throat about that. Doing so outside of regulated channels where staff have explicitly allowed the discussion for a short period of time is not allowed ( #poll-discussion is one such example of an okay place to talk about it provided the poll allows it )

## 5. Only speak English in chat

This speaks for itself, we do not expect staff to speak extra languages and we cannot moderate what we do not understand. Sorry.

## 6. Do not ask for free work

This is not an advertisement platform. If you are going to take from this community, you are going to give back to it first. We do not care about your work if you do not care about us. Thanks.

## 7. Do not DM people who you have not built a rapport with.

This is self explanatory. Don't be a creep. Don't be a pest, ask questions in relevant channels. Someone's DM is not a relevant channel.

## 8. Do not talk about your infractions publicly

If you are infracted, it's not a big deal. It's simply a formal warning - you can totally recover from that. If you disagree with a warning, DM @ModMail. Complaining about infractions publicly will land you a mute or a ban. Don't pollute chat or other channels with these conversations.

## 9. Do not participate in spoonfeeding.

Asking to be spoonfed is the same as asking someone else to do your work for you. We do not condone just solving the problems of others -- make them work for it. Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

## 10. Do not impersonate staff members

If you setup your account to impersonate a staff member's (e.g. steal their old avatar and name) we will give you 30 minutes from the time we find out about it for you to fix that.

## 11. Follow the directions of staff members to the letter

Most of us are here for our love of programming, so we like to do as much talking about programming and the like as possible. That being said, we really don't like intervening. But we especially don't like having to intervene twice. Please don't make us do that, thank you :slight_smile:

## 12. No backseat driving

If you see people working through a problem, you shouldn't intermittently interject advice. Let them work it out unless someone asks for help. We understand you want to help out, but this can often cause confusion and overall a negative impact on the person who originally asked the question.
